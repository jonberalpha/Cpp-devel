## Doc-folder

In the folder doc there are all documents stored which are created while working on the project. This includes e.g. the initial project description.

## Before Starting

Make sure to install the installpackages.sh as root via the command __sudo sh installpackages.sh__
This makes sure that all necessary packages to build the program are installed. Moreover
the python packages are installed too to ensure that also the python-tests can be executed without initial setup.

## Build and Execute the Program

* Build the program using __cmake__
* Execute the program using __sudo ./build/Application/Application__ or navigate to the build-subdirectory Application and use __sudo ./Application__
